        If you have happened to stumble upon this page then congratulations! You
        are likely one of the few people who will ever see it. Make sure to take
        it in in all its glory. The beautiful CSS that I totally designed myself
        and did not at all use a CSS framework found at
        <a href="https://bulma.io">https://bulma.io</a>. Anyway that aside this
        is where I will be posting things that come to mind. Nothing super
        interesting just things that I want to talk about to myself and possibly
        anyone that reads this.

        You may be asking yourself why someone would even created something like
        this on a small website they made themselves in a few days and called
        their "professional portfolio"? I honestly have no idea. I am hesitent
        to call this a "blog" of any sort because I am sure the post frequency
        is going to be anything but consistent. That and blogs feel cringey
        despite that being exactly what I am doing with the exception of calling
        it something different. Either way back to the question. Again I have no
        idea. I guess I really enjoy talking to myself and hope that someone
        will enjoy listening, or maybe I really enjoy suffering having to type
        all of this into VSCode which was 100% NOT designed for this type of
        writing.

        Could I have queried a content server of some sort? Probably. Could I
        have written this all in a Google Doc and imported it through a txt or
        JSON file? Yup. Could I have created my own admin panel that would allow
        me to make posts from a nice GUI with some grammer rules integrated
        through a Google API of some sort? Absolutely. Then why don't you is
        probably what you are thinking. Maybe I enjoy writing code in a basic
        text editor like some sort of vim elitest. Maybe I like making grammer
        mistakes everywhere thereby reinforcing the stereotype of STEM majors
        being completely unable to write intelligble English. Maybe I have too
        many personal projects that I never 100% finished, making the prospect
        of adding yet more work to my summer that is already packed with two
        research projects and a Google fellowship. Maybe I've said maybe too
        many times and should get off this topic.
      </p>

        I'm sure I'll eventually have to design some sort of system to allow
        writing to be a bit easier. I can only imagine how long this HTML
        document is going to get and I really shouldn't continue doing it this
        way. That probably won't stop me from making enough posts that it takes
        me a few extra hours to port these ones over to whatever method I come
        up with for long term storage. If I were smart I wouldn't let that
        happen, so I guess we will see.

        If you happen to be a recruiter of any sort reading this your time might
        be better served looking at my GitHub linked in the navigation bar. Who
        am I to tell you what to do though? Maybe you have the same sense of
        humor as me. Either way I hope anyone that read this enjoyed it, or
        maybe felt a little more relieved to realize that none of us in CS
        really know what we are doing. Anyway I should go work on my glorified
        spreadsheet. Have a good one.
