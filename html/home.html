    <div class="content">
      My name is Jacob Whitlow and I am computer science student at California
      State University, Fresno. After earning my B.S. in Computer Science I plan
      to work in industry as a software engineer in the California Bay Area. Alongside
      school I work as the Database Team Lead for iAgriculture DMS in Fresno,
      California. The work I do involves building and maintaining databases in
      Microsoft Azure, as well as building APIs to allow interaction with these
      databases. The languages and technologies I work with are Python, MSSQL,
      Microsoft Azure Service Bus, Microsoft Azure Data Queue, and anything else
      I need to learn to get my work done. While I do not actively work with
      these languages I do have a strong foundation in C++ and Lua from past
      experiences and projects.

      My current long-term goals include graduating from college with my
      Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and earning my black belt in muay thai.
      I plan to return to training muay thai after I graduate college as I do not
      have the time for it between school and other projects.

      My current interests include software engineering, machine learning, and just
      about anything that involves the organization and utilization of large
      amounts of data. Aside from career related interests I spend time playing video
      games with my significant other (I highly recommend It Takes Two if you
      have another person to play it with) and riding motorcycles/dirt bikes.
