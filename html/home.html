    <div class="content">
      My name is Jacob Whitlow and I am computer science student at California
      State University, Fresno. After earning my B.S. in Computer Science I plan
      to attend graduate school and earn my M.S. in Computer Science.
      <br />
      Alongside school I work as the Database Team Lead for iAgriculture DMS in
      Fresno, California. The work I do involves building and maintaining
      databases in Microsoft Azure, as well as building APIs to allow
      interaction with these databases. The languages and technologies I
      currently work with are Python, MSSQL, Microsoft Azure Service Bus,
      Microsoft Azure Data Queue, and anything else I need to learn in order to
      get my work done. While I do not actively work with these languages I do
      have a strong foundation in C++ and Lua from past experiences and
      projects.
      <br />
      My current interests include data science, machine learning, and just
      about anything that involves the organization and utilization of large
      amounts of data. I am currently unsure of what part of industry I would
      like to work in once I complete my education, but it will likely be
      closely related to data science.
